## ðŸš€ Quick start

**To run the project**

Get Gatsby and JSON GraphQL server running with one npm script command:

```shell
npm start
```

**Wishlist**

Things I would have liked to do, if I had more time.

- Improved the AddAnimal/Update code by using a HOC, they're basically the same thing but smooshing them into one component was messy.

- Linting
  polling
  only run tests once - mock?
  use gql for state
